This project was created during Devbridge Sourcery Academy for developers. It is a very simple app which I revisited and improved afterwards in my university studies. 

Web app contains:
* Creating a multiple question survey with different types of questions
* Data aggregation for survey completed by multiple users
* User management
* Dashboard with statistics for form editor
